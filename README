This is a syntax highlighting for Nexus, a file format used by many programs in evolutionary biology, like GDA, Paup*, Mesquite, ModelTest, MrBayes and MacClade. A formal description can be found at

Maddison, D.R., D.L. Swofford, and W.P. Maddison. 1997. NEXUS: An extensible file format for systematic information. Systematic Biology 46: 590-621

while some examples and a short description can be found at

http://workshop.molecularevolution.org/resources/fileformats/

The syntax also takes in consideration some reserved words (private block) used for MrBayes. For the most curious, a screenshot can be seen at
