This is a syntax highlighting for Nexus, a file format used by many programs in evolutionary biology, like GDA, Paup*, Mesquite, ModelTest, MrBayes and MacClade. A formal description can be found at:

Maddison, D.R., D.L. Swofford, and W.P. Maddison. 1997. NEXUS: An extensible file format for systematic information. Systematic Biology 46: 590-621

This syntax file also takes in consideration reserved words (private block) used particularly in the MrBayes dialect of the Nexus standard. The script is derived from the work of Luis Carvalho, originally published http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=964 (see also GitHub parent).
